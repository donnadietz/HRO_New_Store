Data Sources

#FCC DATABASE (I needed to use anonymous ftp to manually download!  Yuck!  But I got the files!)
https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly#fcc-uls-transaction-files-weekly    (l_amat/EN.dat)

I have a python3 script (convertEN.py) that converted/cleaned the EN.dat into EN.csv

#I had to log in to Kaggle to nab this file.  It allows me to match zipcodes with probable counties.
#When a zipcode crosses counties, it takes the one with the "most" in some sense.

#And I still needed this file to give me a master list of all the counties,
#because otherwise the map turns ugly "gray" in the counties without data.
